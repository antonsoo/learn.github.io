<h1>AncientLanguages — Privacy Policy (Donations &amp; Memberships)</h1>
<p class="muted"><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1 &nbsp; <strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-10-13</p>

<h2>1) Scope</h2>
<p>This policy covers personal data we receive when you support AncientLanguages via Stripe, GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, Open Collective, Ko-fi, Liberapay, or cryptocurrency. It does not cover general app usage (see separate app privacy terms if applicable).</p>

<h2>2) Data we collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>You provide:</strong> email, display name/username (varies by platform), amount, currency, frequency (one-time/recurring), optional notes.</li>
  <li><strong>From platforms/processors:</strong> limited payment metadata (e.g., transaction IDs, card brand &amp; last 4 for card payments, status/failure codes), timestamps, and your platform handle/ID. We do not receive or store full card numbers.</li>
  <li><strong>Crypto:</strong> sending address, receiving address we publish, transaction hash, amount, time, and any memo/tag (public blockchain data).</li>
</ul>

<h2>3) Processors and platforms</h2>
<p>We rely on third parties to process payments and manage memberships: Stripe, GitHub (Sponsors), Patreon, Open Collective, Ko-fi, Liberapay, and public blockchain networks for crypto. They process data under their own terms and privacy policies.</p>

<h2>4) Purposes of use</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Issue receipts/confirmations and manage recurring billing.</li>
  <li>Reconcile accounts; comply with tax and accounting obligations.</li>
  <li>Prevent fraud/abuse; defend against chargebacks and disputes.</li>
  <li>Communicate about your support or account issues.</li>
  <li>Produce aggregate, non-identifying analytics (e.g., number of donors per month).</li>
</ul>

<h2>5) Legal bases (EU/UK where applicable)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Contract / Legitimate interests:</strong> process support, operate and secure the service.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal obligation:</strong> retain transaction records.</li>
  <li><strong>Consent:</strong> optional marketing communications (only if you explicitly opt in).</li>
</ul>

<h2>6) Sharing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>With the platforms and processors listed above.</li>
  <li>With service providers for bookkeeping, storage, email, and security—bound by confidentiality and data-processing terms.</li>
  <li>With authorities where required by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not sell personal data.</p>

<h2>7) Retention</h2>
<p>We retain transaction records and related personal data as needed for legal, accounting, and operational purposes (typically 7–10 years for financial records, depending on jurisdiction). Blockchain records are public and persistent.</p>

<h2>8) International transfers</h2>
<p>Platforms and processors may store or process data globally. Where required, transfers rely on safeguards such as SCCs, adequacy decisions, or equivalent mechanisms used by those providers.</p>

<h2>9) Security</h2>
<p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures appropriate to the risks of handling supporter data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>10) Your rights</h2>
<p>Subject to local laws, you can request access, correction, deletion, or portability; object to or restrict processing; and withdraw consent (for any optional marketing) at any time. We may need to retain certain records for legal reasons even after a deletion request.</p>

<h2>11) Children</h2>
<p>Support channels are not directed to children under 13 (or the relevant minimum age). Do not submit children’s personal data.</p>

<h2>12) Contact</h2>
<p><strong>Data controller:</strong> Anton Soloviev (sole proprietor), “AncientLanguages”.<br>

<h2>13) Changes</h2>
